# Usage Instructions
Codes in this repository are for PSO and MSPSO described in the publication. Additional functions for the complete backcalculation scheme include: 1) Kriging model constructed with finite element model results; 2) user-defined function calculating differences between the pavement responses predicted by the constrcuted Kriging model and measured from the field testing.
